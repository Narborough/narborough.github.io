Determining what coding assessment platform to use?
Candidates were BOJ and LeetCode.
I decided to use LeetCode for corperates abroad.

Recently I had a code test for an interview.
To write codes for an interview was pretty awkward,
cause I haven't done it since the last interview(8 years ago).
Reminded me of time in the university.
And this code assessment services were not exsisted at the time.
So I stumbled hard at the test.

New things I have to learn to use these platforms,
and old things I have to recall to do it swiftly.
Gotta do it one by one in a steady manner.
Feels like I prepare for a SAT(even though never took it)
after all these years.
But guess I have to stay sharp to be a programmer.
